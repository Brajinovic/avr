When I tried to connect the AtTiny to the AtMega, I did it in a way that I connected the MOSI - PB0 of the AtTiny (master) and the MOSI of the AtMega (slave). And when I connected all of that, I used the code generated by ChatGPT and it did not work. I have searched for 2 weekends for the error and in the end it was something stupid. What happend is that the MISO and MOSI pins at the AtTiny not for the USI are. They are for SPI one uses when uploading the sketch to the AtTiny and not for the "SPI" communicatoin through the USI interface. 

The way I found that out is by looking at the datasheet of the AtTiny 85 where I saw alongside the MOSI and MISO, DI and DO pins which correspond with the block diagram of the USI interface. Even now when I look at the rest of the documentation, there is some mention of SPI, even on the individual Pins but there is not explanation on how I could use it apart from the programming aspect.
